3 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Motor Imagery decoding. Multiclass (3), ALS patient data decoding. 
The data is provided by Penn State for 8 ALS patients over the course of 1-2 Months of monitoring spread across approx. 160 sessions.

Novelty: 
1) Application of deep learning structures to end user datasets. This contributes to benchmarks for models on ALS data.
2) Providing automatically adaptive models over time
3) 

Model To do list: 
1) CNN (3D Complete, 2D incomplete, Also testing different inputs i.e. Raw vs Frequency vs Spatial)
2) RNN - LSTM
3) LSTM + CNN (Simultaneous processing of frequency and raw data)
4)
